## Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An intrusion occurs when security mechanisms are bypassed, enabling unauthorized access to an organizationâ€™s resources. Intrusion detection is a monitoring method that examines recorded information and real-time events to identify abnormal activities indicative of potential incidents or intrusions. 

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) automates log inspection and real-time event analysis to detect intrusion attempts and system failures, complementing other security measures like firewalls.

- **Detection Capabilities:**
  - Identifies external and internal attacks.
  - Recognizes anomalies and responds with alerts or alarms.

- **Integration with Security Plan:**
  - Part of a defense-in-depth strategy.
  - Works alongside, but doesn't replace, other security mechanisms.

### Host-based IDS (HIDS)

- Monitors a single computer.
- Examines detailed events, including process calls and logs.
- Detects specific file compromises and tracks attacker processes.
- Can identify anomalies on the host system that network-based IDSs cannot.
- More management-intensive, requiring attention on each system.

### Network-based IDS (NIDS)

- Monitors network traffic patterns.
- Supports centralized administration.
- Detects network attacks on other systems.
- Generally more cost-effective to manage compared to HIDS.
