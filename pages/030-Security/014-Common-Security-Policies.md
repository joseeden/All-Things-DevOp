## Continuous Change Management Cycle

- **Ongoing Process**: Change management is a continuous cycle that requires constant monitoring and approvals.

- **Coordination Responsibility**: Information Security professionals often coordinate and oversee change management.
- **Departmental Involvement**: It can fall under IT, development, quality, or risk management departments.
- **Comprehensive Oversight**: Involves input from end users, various IT areas, and management to ensure proper testing, approval, and communication before implementation.
