## Cryptography

The science and practice of securing communication and information through encoding, ensuring only authorized parties can access it. Its purpose is to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity.


- **Steganography**
    - Hiding secret data within ordinary, non-secret files or messages.
    - Purpose is to avoid detection.

- **Masking/Obfuscation**
    - Take an information and hide it so that it doesn't make sense to external observer.

- **Diffusion**
    - Making the information less visible, less obvious.
    - Example is blurring an image.

- **Confusion**
    - Changing a property of the data and make it more difficult to interpret, more unintelligible.
    - Confusion works alongside diffusion to create robust encryption schemes.
    - Example is scrambling or changing the pixels of an image.

- **Tokenization**
    - Substituting sensitive data elements with non-sensitive equivalents called **tokens.**
    - Tokens have no intrinsic or exploitable meaning.

- **Encryption**
    - Transforming plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key.

- **Decryption**
    - Converting ciphertext back to plaintext with the appropriate key.

## Types of Encryption 

These types of encryption play critical roles in modern cybersecurity, often used together to achieve a balance of speed and security.

### Symmetric Encryption 

Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. The sender and receiver must share this key, keeping it secret from others.

- **Session key** - single key is used to encrypt and decrypt data. 
- Both parties must have this key.

Symmetric encryption is generally faster and less computationally intensive compared to asymmetric cryptography. It is also effective for encrypting large volumes of data.

</p>

Sending the key:

- **In-band** 
    - Sending the key along with the encrypted data
    - Risky, vulnerable to sniffing 

- **Out-of-band** 
    - Providing the key separately from the encrypted data
    - Can be provided beforehand or via phone/SMS

Disadvantages:

- Key distribution and management can be challenging
- If the key is compromised, the entire system is at risk.

Use Cases:

- Secure communication within closed networks
- Encrypting files or databases
- Securing backups.

### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric cryptography uses a pair of keys: 

- a public key for encryption 
- a private key for decryption. 

The public key can be shared openly, but the private key must remain confidential.

- <mark>**Public key encrypts data**</mark>, and only the corresponding private key can decrypt it. 
- <mark>**Private key decrypts the data**</mark>, can be used to sign data, which the public key can verify.

<p align=center>
<img width=500 src='../../Images/sec+-asymmetric-encryption-example-diagran.png'>
</p>


Example Algorithms:

- **RSA** (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- **ECC** (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- **DSA** (Digital Signature Algorithm).


Advantages: 

- No need to share the private key, reducing the risk of key compromise.
- Allows for digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI).

Disadvantages: 

- Slower and more resource-intensive than symmetric cryptography. 
- Less efficient for large amounts of data.

Use Cases: 

- Secure communication over public networks, digital signatures, certificate authorities, and secure key exchange. 

### Hybrid Implementation 

Utilizes asymmetric encryption to securely transfer a private key, which can then be used with symmetric encryption.

## Storing Keys 

Best practices:

- Store keys in secure hardwared modules 
- Encrypt keys when at rest 
- Transmit keys securely when used
- Limit key access to regular audits and monitoring

## Ciphers

A cipher is an algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt information, transforming plain text into coded (cipher) text and vice versa. 

- Ciphers ensure data confidentiality 
- Central to encryption protocols.

Types of Ciphers:

- Stream Cipher
- Block Cipher


### Stream Ciphers

Stream Ciphers encrypt data bit by bit or byte by byte in a continuous stream.

- Performs encryption on <mark>**single byte at a time.**</mark>
- Uses a key stream generator to create a pseudo-random sequence of bits (the key stream).
- The key stream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext.

**Common Features**:

- <mark>**Uses same key for encryption and decryption.**</mark>
- Implemented mostly on <mark>**hardware-based solutions**
- Often used in <mark>**real-time applications**</mark> where data is continuously transmitted (e.g., streaming services).
- Vulnerable to certain types of attacks if key stream is reused or not sufficiently random.

**Examples**: 

- RC4
- Salsa20
- ChaCha20

### Block Ciphers

Block Ciphers break the input into fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64-bit or 128-bit) and performs the encryption on each block.

- Performs encryption on <mark>**per block basis.**</mark>
- A block of plaintext is processed with a key to produce a block of ciphertext.
- Multiple rounds of transformation can also be used (e.g., substitution and permutation).

**Common Features**:
- <mark>**Easier to implement, less susceptible to security problems.**
- Implemented mostly on <mark>**software solutions**
- Often used in protocols and file encryption, where data is processed in chunks.
- Require padding when the plaintext doesn't evenly divide into block sizes.
- Can be operated in various modes to enhance security or support specific applications.

**Examples**: 
- AES
- DES
- 3DES


## Common Ciphers

### Cease Cipher 

Named after Julius Caesar, it is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.
- Shifts each letter in the plaintext a certain number of positions along the alphabet.
- The number of positions to shift, typically between 1 and 25.
- Example: With a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
- **ROT2** - two shifts in positions
- **ROT3** - three shifts in positions, and so on.

Although it's historically significant, the Caesar Cipher is not used for serious encryption today due to its simplicity and vulnerability to straightforward cryptanalysis

</p>

### Vigenere Cipher

The Vigen√®re Cipher is a type of polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a repeating key phrase to determine shifting patterns for each letter in the plaintext, offering greater security than simple substitution ciphers.

- A key phrase, repeated to match the plaintext length, determines the shift for each letter.
- To decrypt, use the same key to reverse the shifts and recover the plaintext.


**Strengths**: 
- Provides increased complexity, making frequency analysis and brute-force attacks more difficult.

**Weaknesses**: 
- Susceptible to Kasiski examination and Friedman tests, which can reveal key patterns and lengths, leading to cryptanalysis.

**Example**: 
- With the key "LEMON," the plaintext "HELLO" is encrypted by shifting each letter according to the corresponding letter in the key, resulting in "OIWWC."

</p>

### Exlusive OR (XOR) 

Exclusive OR (XOR) is a binary operation used extensively in cybersecurity and cryptography. It operates on bits, returning 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. Here's a concise description with key bullet points:

- XOR compares two bits; if they're different, it outputs 1; if they're the same, it outputs 0.
- XOR is reversible, allowing data encrypted with a key to be decrypted by XORing again with the same key.

</p>


**Applications**:

  - **Encryption**: 
    - Commonly used in stream ciphers and some block ciphers to combine plaintext with a key stream, creating ciphertext.

  - **One-Time Pad (OTP)**: 
    - A theoretically unbreakable encryption method that uses XOR with a key as long as the plaintext, provided the key is truly random and never reused.

  - **Data Manipulation**: 
    - XOR can be used to toggle bits or swap values without additional storage.

  - **Error Detection/Correction**: 
    - In parity checks and error-correcting codes, XOR helps identify errors in transmitted or stored data.


**Security Considerations**:
  - **Key Management**: 
    - Security in XOR-based encryption relies heavily on key secrecy and randomness.

  - **Vulnerabilities**: 
    - If the key is reused or predictable, XOR-based encryption is susceptible to various attacks, including known-plaintext attacks.



## Hashing

Hashing is a process of converting data (like a file or a message) into a fixed-size value or string, typically using a hash function.

- Used for data integrity checks, digital signatures, password storage, and more.
- The same input always produces the same hash output.
- **Fixed Size**: Hash outputs are of fixed length, regardless of input size.
- **Fast Computation**: Hash functions are designed to be quick to compute.
- **Irreversible**: Not feasible to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash.
- **Collision Resistance**: Unlikely for two different inputs to produce the same hash (a "collision").
  
**Common Uses**
- Verify data hasn't been altered (e.g., checksums).
- Securely store passwords, often with added salt.
- Create digital signatures by compressing data before signing.
- Used in various cryptographic operations, including blockchains.


### Digital Signature

The digital signature is the encrypted hash which is sent along with the message to prove the integrity of the message.

- Uses a private key to create the signature and a public key to verify it.
- The digital signature confirms the sender's identity.
- This ensures the message hasn't been altered.
- **Non-repudiation** - signer can't deny signing because there's proof.

### Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

DSS, or the Digital Signature Standard, is a cryptographic standard used for generating and verifying digital signatures. 

- Established by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** in the United States.
- Ensures authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation for digital data through digital signatures.
- Relies upon a 160-bit message digest created by the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)


**How it works:**

  - Public-private key pairs is created for signing and verifying.
  - Private key is used to generate a digital signature from a message hash.
  - The public key verifies the digital signature and check the message's integrity.


### Code Signing

Code signing is the process of digitally signing software code or executables to verify their origin and ensure their integrity.

- Verifies that the code is from a trusted developer or publisher.
- Ensures the code hasn't been modified since it was signed.
- Protects users from malicious software and unauthorized code changes.

**How It Works**:

  - A software developer uses a private key to create a digital signature for their code.
  - The digital signature is attached to the code, forming a certificate.
  - A user or system uses the public key to verify the signature.
  - The public key confirms the software's source and that it hasn't been tampered with.

**Use Cases**:
  - Software distribution, ensuring safe installation of programs and updates.
  - Application stores, confirming that apps meet security standards.
  - Operating systems, allowing signed drivers and system software.

**Common Tools**:

  - **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**: Organizations that issue digital certificates to verify the identity of the signer.
  - **Code Signing Certificates**: Certificates issued to developers for signing their code.

**Challenges**:

  - **Certificate Management**: Properly handling and securing code signing certificates.
  - **Revocation**: Handling compromised or invalid certificates.
  - **Cost**: Obtaining code signing certificates from reputable CAs can be expensive.
  


## Hash Functions 

Hash functions convert input data into a fixed-size hash value. Below are some of the common algorithms used for hashing.

### MD5

An older hash function, MD5 is now considered insecure due to known collisions.

- Creates a 128-bit hash value unique to the input file.
- 128-bits long means it can only create limited values, which can lead to collisions.
- **Collisions** - when two distinct inputs produce the same hash.
- Despite its insecurities, it's still used for checksums and non-security-sensitive applications.


### SHA Family  

A family of cryptographic hash functions designed by the National Security Agency (NSA).

- **SHA-1**: 
    
    - Creates a 160-bit hash digest, reducing chance of collisions.
    - More secure than MD5, but also deprecated due to vulnerabilities.
    - Formerly used for digital signatures; now discouraged.

- **SHA-2**: 

    - Hash family containing longer hash digests.
    - Includes:
        - SHA-224
        - SHA-256
        - SHA-384
        - SHA-512

- **SHA-256**: 

   - Part of the SHA-2 family, SHA-256 offers a 256-bit output.
   - Stronger security, highly collision-resistant, and a commonly used standard.
   - Secure communication, SSL/TLS, and blockchain.

- **SHA-3**: 

   - A newer family of hash functions
   - Hash digest can go between **224 to 512 bits.**
   - Uses **120 rounds of computations** to create the message digest.
   - SHA-3 uses a different underlying algorithm (Keccak).
   - Designed to provide high security and flexibility.
   - Used in applications requiring a strong hash function with versatility.


### RIPEMD


RIPEMD stands for **Race Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest.** It is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed to ensure data integrity and secure hashing.

- A family of cryptographic hash functions developed in Europe.
- Comes in **160/256/320-bit versions**
- **RIPEMD-160** is the most known, with a 160-bit output.
- Offers strong security and is used as an alternative to SHA-1.

### HMAC

Stands for "Hash-based Message Authentication Code", HMAC uses a hash function combined with a secret key to generate a message authentication code (MAC).

- Uses a hash function and secret key for message authentication.
- HMAC provides message integrity and authentication.
- Ensures that a message has not been tampered with and verifies identity of the sender.

Commonly paired with other algorithms for additional security:


- **HMAC-MD5**: 

    - Historically used for message authentication and checksum verification.
    - Now considered insecure due to the vulnerabilities in MD5

- **HMAC-SHA1**: 

    - Offers more security than HMAC-MD5.
    - SHA-1 is now deprecated due to known vulnerabilities and potential collision attacks.

- **HMAC-SHA256**: 

    - Offers stronger security and used widely in modern cryptographic applications.
  
    - Most recommended for secure applications.
