## Quality of Intelligence 

Consider and measure the quality of intelligence.

- **Timeliness**
    Property of an intelligence source that ensures it is up-to-date.

- **Relevancy**
    Property of an intelligence source that ensures it matches the use cases intended for it.

- **Accuracy**
    Property of an intelligence source that ensures it produces effective results.Information needs to be valid and true.

- **Confidence Levels**
    Property of an intelligence source that ensures it produces qualified statements about reliability.

## Types of intelligence

### Proprietary

Threat intelligence is very widely provided as a commercial service offering, where access to updates and research is subject to a subscription fee 

- Some of these are repackaged information. 
- Not nearly as useful.

### Closed-Source

Data that is derived from the provider's own research and analysis efforts, such as data from honeynets that they operate, plus information mined from its customers' systems, suitably anonymized

- Good example is **Fireeye**

### Open-Source

Data that is available to use without subscription, which may include threat feeds similar to the commercial providers and may contain reputation lists and malware signature databases

- US-CERT
- UKâ€™s NCSC
- AT&T Security (previously Alienvault OTX)
- MISP
- VirusTotal
- Spamhaus
- SANS ISC Suspicious Domains

### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Methods of obtaining information about a person or organization through public records, websites, and social media.

## Implicit and Explicit Knowledge 

All of the threat feeds mentioned previously as intelligence sources are considered **explicit knowledge**, but **explicit knowledge** comes from years of experience.
