# Security Controls 


Security controls, including physical, technical, and administrative measures, safeguard information systems for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The aim is to implement controls that effectively reduce risk to an acceptable level.

- [Physical Controls](#physical-controls)
- [Technical Controls](#technical-controls)
- [Administrative Controls](#administrative-controls)


## Physical Controls

Physical controls addresses security needs with hardware like badge readers and architectural features.

- **Scope:**
  - Control movement in specific locations (e.g., office, factory).
  - Cover entry points and surrounding areas.

- **Integration with Technical Controls:**
  - Supported by technical controls for an overall security system.

- **Examples:**
  - Visitors use designated entrance, undergo identification.
  - Employees use badges or tokens for identity verification.
  - Technical controls integrate hardware for a seamless security setup:
    - readers
    - door release mechanisms
    - access control systems 

## Technical Controls

Also termed "logical controls", Technical controls are implemented directly by computer systems and networks.

- **Functions:**
  - Automated protection against unauthorized access.
  - Facilitate detection of security violations.
  - Support security requirements for applications and data.

- **Implementation:**
  - Configuration settings, parameters, or hardware settings.
  - Managed through software GUI or hardware.

- **Considerations:**
  - Requires significant operational considerations.
  - Must align with organizational security management.

- **Examples:**
  - Access Control List

## Administrative Controls

Also known as "managerial controls", Administratice controls refers to directives, guidelines, or advisories for organization members.

- **Purpose:**
  - Establish frameworks, constraints, and standards for human behavior.
  - Encompass all organizational activities and interactions.

- **Importance:**
  - Powerful tools for achieving information security.
  - Even simple awareness policies can be effective controls.

- **Integration Strategies:**
  - Improve overall security by integrating controls into daily task-level activities.
  - Offer in-context references, advisory resources, or link directly into training.

- **Operational Impact:**
  - Shifts from executive decision-making to daily use.
  - Enhances immediacy, usefulness, and operational relevance.

- **Examples:**
  - Acceptable Use Policy 
  - Emergency Operations Procedures 
  - Employee Awareness Training
