## Quality of Intelligence 

Consider and measure the quality of intelligence.

- **Timeliness** - Property of an intelligence source that ensures it is up-to-date.

- **Relevancy** - Property of an intelligence source that ensures it matches the use cases intended for it.

- **Accuracy** - Property of an intelligence source that ensures it produces effective results.Information needs to be valid and true.

- **Confidence Levels** - Property of an intelligence source that ensures it produces qualified statements about reliability.

## Types of intelligence

### Proprietary

Threat intelligence is very widely provided as a commercial service offering, where access to updates and research is subject to a subscription fee 

- Some of these are repackaged information. 
- Not nearly as useful.

### Closed-Source

Data that is derived from the provider's own research and analysis efforts, such as data from honeynets that they operate, plus information mined from its customers' systems, suitably anonymized

- Good example is **Fireeye**

### Open-Source

Data that is available to use without subscription, which may include threat feeds similar to the commercial providers and may contain reputation lists and malware signature databases

- US-CERT
- UKâ€™s NCSC
- AT&T Security (previously Alienvault OTX)
- MISP
- VirusTotal
- Spamhaus
- SANS ISC Suspicious Domains

### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Methods of obtaining information about a person or organization through public records, websites, and social media.

### Dark Web 

The Dark Web is a part of the internet that is intentionally hidden and requires special software like Tor to access.
- It is a segment of the Deep Web, but  is often associated with illegal or illicit activities.
- Often monitored by law enforcement due to its association with cybercrime and illegal trade.
- Contents are not indexed by search engine like Google
- Uses Tor network, which is sits over standard internet protocol.
- Encrypted anonymous connections

## Implicit and Explicit Knowledge 

All of the threat feeds mentioned previously as intelligence sources are considered **explicit knowledge**, but **explicit knowledge** comes from years of experience. 

## Automated Indicator Sharing 

Uses a specialized format called **Structured Threat Information Expression (STiX)** to package threat intelligence information.

- Exchange of cybersecurity intelligence between entities

- Uses **Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)** to transmit the packaged information 
- TAXII is like an RSS feed
- Normally built-in on security monitoring tools
