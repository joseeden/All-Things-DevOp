## Learning Activities

Security Awareness Training communicates expectations, responsibilities, and identifies potential risks to align information security goals with the organization's mission and vision.

- **Education**
    - The objective is to enhance learners' comprehension of concepts and their application to real-world scenarios.

- **Training**
    - Aims at developing proficiency in specific skills, encompassing decision-making capabilities on when and how to apply these skills, ranging from low-level to complex tasks.

- **Awareness**
    - Engages learners by introducing them to aspects of an issue, concern, problem, or need to capture their attention.

## Examples

**Fire Safety in the Workplace**

- **Education:** Understanding the interaction of fire and smoke detectors, suppression systems, alarms, and their connection to electrical power, lighting, and ventilation systems in a secure server room.
- **Training:** Task-specific learning on proper actions during alarms, suppression system activation, ventilation system failure, etc., building on educational activities.
- **Awareness:** Posting signage, floor markings, and other indicators for constant reminders and appropriate actions during alarms.

**Anti-Phishing Campaign**

- **Education:** Helping users understand social engineering attacks, engaging them in creating and testing defensive strategies.
- **Training:** Increasing proficiency in recognizing phishing attempts, practicing correct responses, including simulated phishing emails to test identification skills.
- **Awareness:** Raising overall awareness of phishing threats, alerting users to new tactics and approaches in phishing, vishing, SMS phishing (smishing).

## Incident Response Exercises

To learn more about Incident Response, please see [Incident Response Plan.](./006-Incident-Responses.md)


### Walk-Through Exercise

- Reviews each step of an incident to ensure team members know what to do.
- Confirms clarity on actions and procedures.

### Tabletop Exercise 

- Presenting a scenario, prompting team members to discuss and plan their responses.
- Focuses on response strategies and relevant tasks.
- **Least impact on system operations** - does not involve actual disruption or cost-effective.

### Penetration Testing Exercise 

- Actually getting people on the network.
- Simulate network intrusion based on threat scenarios.
- There's a **specific goal in mind.**
- Agree on methodology and rules of engagement before performing pentests.

### Simulation Exercise

- Recreates an actual incident to thoroughly test response capabilities.
- Provides a realistic scenario to assess practical incident handling.
- Sample scenarios:
    - Phishing or ransomware
    - Multi-stage attacks 
    - data breaches

### Checklists in Incident Response

- Essential tools for guiding and ensuring thorough incident response.
- Not a specific exercise type but a crucial component in the response process.

## Security Awareness versus Security Training 

- **Security Awareness** activities aim to capture the attention of individuals in an organization, making them conscious of security issues or concerns.

- **Security training** is designed to build proficiency in a set of skills or actions in security subjects. It helps employees develop the skills and abilities to protect the organization from threats
