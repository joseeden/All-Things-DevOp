## The Goal

Ideally, the whole team has an effective, dedicated space for the duration of the project.

The space should have everything the team needs to be happy and productive: whiteboards and markers, sticky notes, and any other supplies. This should also be a place where stakeholders can visit to get updates on the project.

## Creating The Right Environment

The team should discuss and decide what their space should include (within reason). Ask them what they need to be comfortable, productive, and successful.

## Ground Rules For A Happy Team

Get your team together and have them create some working agreements, or ground rules. Rules could include things like the following:

* Does everyone understand and agree with the working agreements?
