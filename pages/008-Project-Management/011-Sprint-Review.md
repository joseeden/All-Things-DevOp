## This Is The Time To Shine

In the sprint review meeting, the team demos the product to show the results of the sprint.

The goal of the sprint review meeting is to receive feedback from the sponsor on the user stories that are being delivered, and to find out if they meet the desired goals and value.

It’s also a time for you to reevaluate the vision if you realize it’s off-track or lacking in some way.

## Prepare

This is where the team will showcase its abilities. You want to build your customers’ confidence in your team, even if your customer is your sponsor. It’s good practice to spend the morning before the sprint review preparing.


* Assign each team member an area to present. Team members should prepare a brief demonstration and be ready to answer questions and provide rationale for any decisions made.

* The team should block off an hour to do a complete sprint review run-through before the meeting, to make sure everyone knows exactly what they should be doing, and can successfully demo the completed work.

* The team should provide as much relevant data as necessary to create a compelling discussion.

## Good Questions to Ask

* Does the work being demonstrated meet your expectations?
* Can you articulate to the team those things that need to be changed?
* Has your team delivered the work they committed to deliver? If not, why not?

## Be Prepared To Take Action

You and your sponsor will be invited to the sprint review meeting.

You might want to lead the meeting. Your team members will show you the progress they’ve made during the sprint.

Be prepared to be fully engaged. The team is counting on you and your sponsor to provide critical feedback to them on the work they’ve accomplished to date. Prepare to be open, direct, and transparent.

Here's an example scenario:

> *The working product that your team demonstrated appears to rely on national weather data. There is a cost associated with this data and it is too expensive to use for commercial purposes. What will you say to the team?*

Based on what we've learned, exploring issues together in an open and direct way will encourage your team to step up with new and novel ideas to resolve these kind of issues.

> *Ask the team if there are other ways to make the software without requiring costly data.*
