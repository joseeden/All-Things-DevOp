## What is Agile 

Agile is an iterative project delivery approach used to quickly create something of value.

Unlike the traditional project management approach, where there is a long planning phase, agile-based methodologies produce working, viable products in short, incremental cycles, relying on customer input to quickly launch and improve the product.

This way, you deliver value to the customer right away. The customer gives your team feedback from the very beginning, which shapes and matures the product every step of the way to ensure that they get exactly what they want.

There are all kinds of agile frameworks, tools, and methods that your team can experiment with and adopt for any particular project.

There are so many different flavors or implementations of agile, it can become overwhelming.

Don’t worry about all that just now. Right now, you need to know that you and your team will focus on delivering the most value in the shortest amount of time. This means staying fast and flexible.

Each step in this playbook gives you a window into the agile process. We’ll look at just the essentials you’ll need to consider, and how you’ll know you have each area covered.

## Things to Keep in Mind 

Your project is all about the benefits and the value delivered, whether that’s customer value, business value, or financial value.

Pay attention to what’s being measured and reported by and to senior leadership. It will help you better understand where you can have the greatest impact.

It’s ok to ask your group’s leadership which business outcomes matter most, and where investments should be made.

All hail the Agile Manifesto. The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 to guide and improve software development and is based on a set of four values and twelve principles.

The four core values of agile are:

* We value individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
* We value working software over comprehensive documentation.
* We value customer collaboration over contract negotiations.
* We value responding to change over following a plan.

## Good Questions 

* Does my idea or the thing I’m being asked to do align with or lend itself to an agile mindset?
* Who is my sponsor?
* Who is my customer?
