# Vulnerability Management


## Identifying Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability Scanning 

Automated method of probing networks, systems, and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities.

- Many tools available, including Nessus and OpenVAS.
- These tools can analyze your system's current state against known vulnerabilities.
- They can also generate a detailed report of vulnerabilities and criticality levels.

As a cybersecurity professional, you need to:

- Prioritize
- Patch
- Mitigate


### Application Security Techniques

Used to safeguard the software from being manipulated during it lifecycle.

- Ensures custom software is free from vulnerabilities within its code base.
- To do this, we can do static analysis, dynamic analysis, or package monitoring.

**Static Analysis**

- Involves examining code without executing it, finding issues early.
- This identifies potential vulnerabilities, errors, and code quality issues.
- Uses static analysis tools to automate the inspection process.
- Can detect buffer overflows, SQL injection points, and coding standard violations.
- Can be done through manual reviews or through the use of automated tools.

**Dynamic Analysis** 

- Examining the behavior of a program by executing it in a controlled environment.
- Uses test cases and inputs to observe program behavior.
- Find issues that appears during execution, such as memory leaks and runtime errors.
- Includes techniques like fuzz testing to find security vulnerabilities.
- Can also be used to analyze performance issues.
- Example tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Peach Fuzzer.

**Package Monitoring**

- Keeping track of security of third-party packages and dependencies used.
- Monitors all third-party packages and their versions.
- Alerts developers to known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Ensures that packages are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- Verifies the integrity and authenticity of packages to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Ensures that all packages comply with licensing and security policies.
- Example tools are Snyk and Dependabot.


### Penetration Testing

Used to simulate a real-world attack on a system to evaluate its security posture.

- Attackers are likely to use similar attack vectors and techniques.
- Mitigate the identified issues found in the report.

### Security and Process Auditing

Process that involves conducting a comprehensive review of the information systems, security policies, and procedures. This ensures the organization adheres to security best practices.

**Four-Step Process:**

1. **Planning**
   - Set clear goals for the audit, e.g. compliance, risk assessment, or performance evaluation.
   - Determine the systems, processes, and policies to be reviewed.
   - Allocate the necessary resources, including tools and personnel.
   - Establish a timeline for the audit process.

2. **Testing**
   - Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on test systems.
   - Evaluate current security policies, procedures, and controls.
   - Gather data through interviews, questionnaires, and reviewing documentation.
   - Analyze the collected data to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement.

3. **Implementing**
   - Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings from the testing phase.
   - Create a plan to address identified vulnerabilities and improve security measures.
   - Implement the recommended changes and improvements.
   - Awareness programs, ensuring that staffs understand new policies and procedures.

4. **Auditing**
   - Verify that the implemented changes have been made and are effective.
   - Ensure that all changes comply with relevant regulations and standards.
   - Establish ongoing monitoring processes to maintain security and compliance.
   - Document audit findings, actions taken, and future recommendations.
