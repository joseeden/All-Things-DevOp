## What it is 

The daily scrum (also called the daily coordination meeting) allows the team to coordinate work. This is typically done by answering three questions:

* What did I do yesterday?
* What do I plan to do today?
* Is there anything blocking my work?

Team members will update their tasks progress by moving tasks on the Scrum board, from “To Do” to “In Progress” or “Blocked” or “Done”.

Typically, daily scrum is a morning meeting that lasts 10-15 minutes. The focus of the meeting is to coordinate work, not to give a work status.

## Everyone Needs To Be Present

It is important that all team members attend daily scrum to get a good sense of progress made so far in the sprint, and to determine what others need help with.

## Breaking Through The Barriers

Your team should report if they are experiencing any barriers to getting their work done.

Barriers that cannot be quickly addressed in the meeting will be addressed once the meeting is over in a smaller group setting involving only the relevant people.

## Good Questions to Ask

* Has my Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master scheduled this daily meeting with the team?
* Are all team members aware of the importance of this meeting?
* Do all team members show up to the meeting each day, prepared to share information about their work and any barriers they may be experiencing?

## Be Prepared To Take Action

Your Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master will schedule and lead this meeting.

The information gathered from it will sometimes require you to take action. Be prepared to attend these meetings to help the team’s progress.

As you attend these meetings each day, you’ll see work from the Scrum board “To-Do” column quickly make its way to the “Done” column.
